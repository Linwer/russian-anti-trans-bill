# Translated text of the 30.05.2023 Russian anti-trans bill

This repository contains translated text of the actual bill that is soon to be approved. Additionally it contains the explanatory note which is no less interesting.

With some relevant comments.

## Personal opinion

This is a major step back. 

Not only is legal gender change banned, but prohibiting medical procedures related to gender change (including secondary sexual characteristics) will likely result in stopping hormone replacement therapy for trans people altogether as a medical practice and heavily restricting sales of hormonal medication.

It was one of the very few nice things the queer community had in Russia.

In the financial economic section of the bill they state that "this bill will not require spending of the federal budget". Guess their long term planning doesn't include increase in depression and suicides.
