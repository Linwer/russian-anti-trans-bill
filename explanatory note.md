## to bill "On amendment of the Federal Act "On civil status" and the Federal Act "On the basis of healthcare of citizens of the Russian Federation"

In modern Russia there exists a developed gender change industry, which includes negligent doctors, psychologists, a developed network of LGBT organisations and activists, and other persons. They direct all of their destructive actions unto teenagers and the youth.

The Constitution of the Russian Federation enshrines norms on preserving traditional family values and protecting the institution of marriage as a union of man and woman. The basic law stipulates only two sexes - male and female, no "intermediary" or "additional" sexes or "genders", no categories like "parent #1 and parent #2". There is no provision for "sex change" either.

The federal act [№479-ФЗ dated 05.12.2022](https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_433217/) establishes liability for propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships and propaganda of sex change.

The strategy of national security of the Russian Federation, as approved by [presidential decree №400 "On the strategy of national security of the Russian Federation" dated 02.07.2021](https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_389271/) refers to protection of traditional spiritual and moral foundations of the Russian society as issues of vital importance. The national interests of the Russian Federation and strategies of national importance include, in particular, the protection of the Russian society against destructive influences of informational or psychological nature; the strenghtening of traditional spiritual and moral values of Russia; it is also explicitly stated that achieving these policy goals pertaining to preservation of the Russian people and development of human potential is possible by, among other things, ensuring the stability of the healthcare system; its adaptation to new threats.

[Presidential decree № 809 "On approval of basic government policy to preserve and strengthen traditional spiritual and moral values of Russia](https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_430906/) states that one of the legal instruments for the preservation and strenghthening of traditional values is the improvement of the regulatory legal framework on the federal level.

With all this in mind, the practice of sex change in Russia and the awareness of such possibility is only increasing. The number of legal sex change cases rises accordingly.

The issuance of a sex change certificate, which is required for civil status amendment and approval of medical interventions, is done according to [Decree of the Ministry of Healthcare № 850н "On approval of the form and procedure of a sex change document by medical organisations](https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_288411/). This decree mandates that the "transsexualism" diagnosis is required for the issuance of such a certificate.

According to statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the period between 2016 and 2022 a total of 2990 people applied for a passport change; of them, in 2016 - 142, in 2017 - 131, in 2018 - 370, in 2019 - 429, in 2020 - 428, in 2021 - 554, in 2022 - 996.

One can get a transsexualism diagnosis (F64.0 ICD-10) and a sex change certificate (087/у) without any obstacles whatsoever for about 30000 rubles. From the accounts of parents of affected children it is apparent that sex change certificates can be obtained without a proper medical examination in a few dozens of minutes.

This bill was developed to solve the aforementioned issues. We propose a ban on conducting sex change procedures with the caveat of allowing them for children with congenital physiological anomalies. To approve the procedure of such surgeries a medical committee of a state healthcare organisation will be formed. Amendment of civil status on the basis of medical sex change certificates is to be ruled out.
